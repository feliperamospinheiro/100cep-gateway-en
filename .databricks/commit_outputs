# .databricks/commit_outputs file is used to control whether a notebook's output should be included when committing changes to Git.
# Outputs are included/excluded at a per notebook level, committing select outputs within a specific notebook is not feasible.
#
# Reference:
# each line in .databricks/commit_outputs represents a glob pattern
# line starting with # represents a comment
# notebook that matches a glob pattern will have output included
# line starting with ! represents a exclusion pattern (i.e. !folder_a/\* will exclude output for all notebooks in folder_a)
# if a notebook path matches multiple glob patterns, the last matching glob pattern will be used
# note that glob patterns are case sensitive
# more examples can be found here: https://docs.databricks.com/repos/repos-setup.html#patterns-for-a-repo-config-file

# Uncomment the following pattern to include output for all notebooks
